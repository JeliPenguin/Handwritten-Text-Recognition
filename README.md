# Handwritten-Text-Recognition

## Overview
- Project completed as part of my A-Levels Computer Science final project, I have chosen to do a research project in Python on utilizing convolutional neural networks(CNN) to allow machines to learn to make correct predictions of characters within an image of human-written text, and output onto a console correspondingly. 
- The project involved learning the core concepts of CNN, constructing, training and tuning my own CNN model with Tensorflow and TensorBoard. 
- To correctly segment out individual letters within the given hand-written text, which may be cursive, messy or the combination of the both, I have learned the concepts and implemented various image pre-processing techniques and algorithms such as the watershed algorithm, the distance transform operators to name a few.
- Detail of the project is well documented in the **NEA project report v2019.pdf**

# To run the program
1. Install required libraries through:

```
pip -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run ```main.py``` and then follow instructions on the GUI
